transmitter electrical

This folder is for electrical design images (schematic, PCB layout, 3D view) for the ESP transmitter.

Files to add (suggested names):
- `schematic.png` — EasyEDA schematic export
- `pcb_top.png` — PCB top layer / routing image
- `3d_view.png` — 3D view render

How to add your images locally and push them to GitHub:
1. Copy the images into this folder.
2. From the repo root run:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\73181\Documents\ArduinoData\Arduino\ESP NOW\esp32transmitter"
git add "transmitter electrical/*"
git commit -m "Add transmitter electrical images"
git push
```

If you prefer, upload the image files here and I will add & push them for you.
